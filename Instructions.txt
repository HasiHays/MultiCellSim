## Users without MATLAB
It is possible to install and run the full simulation software without installing MATLAB, which requires a licence. Instead, the user can simply run executable program that downloads and installs MATLAB Runtime in addition to the application MultiCellSim. 

Requirements:
1 Gb of storage, administrator rights on your PC and a working Internet connection.

1. Download the installer "MultiCellSim_Setup.exe".
2. Run the installer. You will first be prompted to choose the installation folder for the software (default: C:\Program Files\TU Delft\MultiCellSim) and then for MATLAB Runtime in case you have not installed it before (default location: C:\Program Files\MATLAB\MATLAB Runtime).
3. The installer will download and install the files for MATLAB Runtime (R2019), which may take a considerable time (~786MB in total), before installing MultiCellSim. 
4. Run the program MultiCellSim. It may take a long time to boot. In the meantime, you will be entertained with a snapshot from a simulation.

Uninstall
Uninstall MultiCellSim as you would uninstall any other program on your Windows PC. Go to Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features, select MultiCellSim and click Uninstall. 
Alternatively, you can manually run the uninstall executable program. First go to the folder in which the software is installed (default: C:\Program Files\TU Delft\MultiCellSim). Go to the subfolder ~\uninstall\bin\win64 (or win32 depending on your PC) and run uninstall.exe.
Note that uninstalling MultiCellSim does not automatically uninstall MATLAB Runtime.
