# Multicellular automaton app
Visualisation of a model for multicellular systems based on secrete-and-sense cells. Continue reading for download and installation instructions, app utilisation guide and more!

### Background
How do communicating cells organize themselves spatially and temporally? We modelled cells that secrete and sense the same signalling molecule as a discrete dynamical system. Through tuning properties such as secretion rate, effective distance between cells and noise level we were able to identify various phases, in some of which cells behave autonomously whereas in others they behave collectively. Our goal here is to provide a direct visualisation of the model for you to get acquainted with our model.

## Installation
#### Requirements
MATLAB (R2018b). Earlier versions of MATLAB from R2016b onwards should also work (manual installation recommended, see below).

#### Instructions
Using the App Installer:
1. Download the .mlappinstall file of the latest release.
2. Run the MATLAB Installer file. The program should unpack itself and install as an app in MATLAB. 
3. Run the app from the "Apps" menu in MATLAB.

Manually (recommended for MATLAB versions before R2018b):
1. Download the source files from the release.
2. Move the content to a location in which you have write permission (to store files). Also, make sure the folder is empty to prevent possible conflicts when running the code.
3. Run the .mlapp file compatible with your MATLAB version to directly run the app. 

## How to use the app
### Basics
The GUI consists of (A) a menu at the top, (B) a left box with tabs for simulating with one and two molecules, with editable fields and switches under each tab, (C) a figure displaying the cellular lattice, (D) buttons for simulation control, (E) controls for modifying cell position and size, (F) buttons for switching between different signal displays, (G) a toggle bar for controlling the speed of the simulation and (H) a message box for output messages. Let's go through the components one by one.

#### Visualisation
Direct visualisation of the multicellular system is presented in the central box (component C). The circles represent the cells and the color their expression level. 

In the case of one signalling molecule, the expression levels are plotted on a grayscale, with darker colors corresponds to a higher expression levels. For the binary system, OFF cells are white and ON cells are black. In the continuous system, the darker of the shade of grey, the higher the expression level of the cell. The color bar on the right shows how the colors match to the exact states of the cells. 

![Gene expression color legend](https://github.com/YitengDang/Multicellularity-app/blob/master/screenshots/colorbar_1_signal_v2.png?raw=true "color legend 1 signal" )

*Fig. 3. Color legend for gene expression of a single gene. Darker colors represent higher relative gene expression level (0 = lowest level, 1 = highest level). For two signals, a similar legend can be made in the app (see below).*

In the case of two signalling molecules, we display the level of the two molecules using yellow and blue colors. Yellow corresponds to gene 1 and blue corresponds to gene 2. Hence for the binary system, 
* A white cell corresponds to the state (0,0), where both genes are off.
* A yellow cell corresponds to the state (1,0), where only gene 1 is on.
* A blue cell corresponds to the state (0,1), where only gene 2 is on.
* A black cell corresponds to the state (1,1), where both genes are on.

The caption above the figure displays the time (in units of time steps) and statistics of the current figure. Here, p is the mean expression level of the cells and I (optionally displayed) is a spatial index measuring the degree of spatial organisation of the cells (see the Olimpio et al. paper). In short, if I=0 the system is fully disordered whereas for |I|->1 the system becomes spatially ordered. For cells with continuous gene expression, the degree of yellowness and degree of blueness represent the degree to which genes 1 and 2 are expressed respectively.

#### Running the simulation
The controls for running the simulation are based on media playback buttons (panel D of Fig. 1). Click on the "PLAY" button to run a new simulation. The "PAUSE" button will pause the simulation and resume once you press "PLAY" again. The simulation continues until the system reaches equilibrium (when none of the cells changes state upon updating), or when the maximum simulation time is reached (by default set to tmax = 10^6). To stop a current simulation or reset a terminated simulation, press the "STOP" button. This erases the current simulation and all data associated with it, so if you intend to save the simulation, do so before you press "STOP". 

The four buttons at the bottom are for going through a simulation without running it for more time (Replay mode). The skip forward and backward buttons skip to the start and end of the current simulation. The seek forward and backward buttons move the simulation by one step in time. At any time, the simulation can be run again by pressing "PLAY". If the simulation did not reach equilibrium, it will continue running after the last frame of the replay has been reached. In the "Simulation" menu, there is an additional option "Skip to time" that allows you to directly skip to a time you input. 

Finally, the "Simulation speed" slider (panel G) controls the speed of the simulation or playback (i.e. how fast the frames follow each other).

#### Display signal
For two types of signals, we can plot both at the same time, or focus on one of the two. The "Display signal" button group (panel F) allows you to toggle between these different views of the cells. Selecting "1" will display the level of gene 1 on a grayscale, "2" displays gene 2 and "both" displays both genes using the color scheme described above.

### Tabs
There are two tabs for simulating cells that communicate in different ways (panel B).

#### Tab 1 signal
The first tab is for simulating a system where the cells communicate through one type of signalling molecule. Detailed descriptions of the variables can be found in the papers listed above. Below is a quick overview of all parameters of the system.

1. **Interaction**. This allows you to toggle between activating and repressive interaction of the single molecule.
2. **Grid size**. Sets the size of the lattice. The constructed lattice will be a triangular lattice with both size consisting of 'grid size' number of cells.
3. **a0**. Effective distance between the cells. This sets the interaction strength between the cells. A small value of a0 corresponds to strongly interacting cells, whereas for large a0 cells have little influence on each other.
4. **K**. Sensing threshold. In the binary system with activating interaction, this sets the threshold for the concentration cells must sense to turn ON. In the continuous system, this is the sensed concentration at which the cells are exactly halfway between their lowest and highest expression levels.
5. **Con**. Maximum secretion rate. This is the secretion rate attained by ON cells in the binary system, or the maximum secretion rate in the continuous system.
6. **Noise**. Stochasticity is modelled as a stochastic term in the sensing threshold K. The value of this field sets the strength of the fluctuations of K. 
7. **Hill coefficient**. Sets the steepness of the response function. A high Hill coefficient corresponds to a sharp response around the value of K, whereas a low value corresponds to a gradual response. By default, it it set to 'Inf' to simulate the binary system. 
8. **p(t=0)**. Initial mean expression level of the system (values between 0 and 1). In the binary system, this corresponds to the initial fraction of ON cells. 
9. **I(t=0)**. Initial spatial index of the system (values between -1 and 1). A value of 0 corresponds to a random distribution of cell states across space, whereas a value close to 1 (-1) corresponds to cell states that are positively (negatively) correlated with each other in space.

#### Tab 2 signals
This tab is for simulating cells that communicate through two types of signalling molecule, which we assume do not directly interfere with each other. However, both are able to influence the state of the cell, and can do so in different ways. This tab is for simulating multiplicative interactions, where the effects to the the two signaling molecules multiply. This corresponds to an AND logic gate in the case of step-function responses. Biophysically, multiplicative interactions can happen when there is a gene with multiple promoters, that requires activators to be bound to all promoters before the gene is transcribed. Concretely, an example of multiplicative interaction is a cell that upregulates its expression of gene 1 only if it senses a high concentration of both signal 1 and signal 2. If one of the two has a low level, the cell will not upregulate its expression level. 

In this case, there is a number of changes in the parameters that describe the system:
1. **lambda12**. This is the ratio between the diffusion length of the two signalling molecules. The diffusion length sets a typical length scale for the decay of the signalling molecule surrounding a given cell. All lengths in the system are expressed with respect to lambda1, the diffusion length of molecule 1. 
2. **K** = K_ij. Instead of a having a single threshold K (for infinite Hill coefficient), we now have a threshold for each interaction of the system. With two molecules, there are four interactions.
3. **Con** = Con_i. Likewise, the two signalling molecules can have different maximum production rates. In addition, there is also the 'OFF' production rate for each gene, Coff_i, which can be different from each other. For simplicity, however, we set Coff_i=1 for all genes.
4. **p1(t=0), p2(t=0)**. We define a mean expression level for each of the two genes. As initial condition we can then set the average gene expression for both genes. 
5. **I1(t=0), I2(t=0)**. Likewise, we define spatial indices for both types of molecules. The two spatial indices are independent of each other for any fixed configuration of the system.

### Menu 
The menu on top has a number of options that are useful for plotting results, importing and exporting data and tuning settings of the simulations. 

#### File
This menu contains the I/O controls as well as controls for closing windows.
* **Save trajectory**. Saves a simulation trajectory as a '.mat' file. The simulation data is stored as a cell array 'CellsHist' that contains the state of the cell at each time step.
* **Open trajectory**. Opens a saved trajectory for replaying. The opened trajectory will stay in memory until the "STOP" (reset) button is pushed or a change is made to the parameter tabs. 
* **Save figures (pdf)**. Saves all opened plots as '.pdf' files after user confirmation for each plot.
* **Save figures (eps)**. Saves all opened plots as '.eps' files after user confirmation for each plot.
* **Save movie (avi)**. Saves the current trajectory as an '.avi' movie. 
* **Save system state (xls)**. Allows the user to save a snapshot of the trajectory as '.xls' file for later use. The snapshot can be reloaded as initial state by selecting "Manually input initial state" under "Options" (see below). Upon selecting, the user is prompted to input the time of the snapshot to be saved.
* **Close all figures**. Closes all plots generated by the user.
* **Close app**. Closes all figures and close the app. It is recommended that you close the app in this way, because closing it by pressing the close button will not close all figures.

#### Simulation
This contains the same controls as the buttons (described under 'Running the simulation') below the figure. It also shows the shortcuts that can be used in place of pressing the buttons.

#### Plot
Here you can find options to plot various properties of the running simulation. This only works if you have run or loaded a simulation and have not pressed the STOP button.
* **Kymograph**. Plots a kymograph or space-time plot of the dynamics. This is useful for quickly getting an overall picture of what is happening in the system.
* **Mean gene expression p(t)**. Plots a trajectory of the mean gene expression against time. If there are two signals, the plot will contain two lines on the same plot.
* **Population fractions pij(t) (binary)**. Plots a trajectory of the relative fractions pij(t) of the cells in state (i,j). Works only for two signals with infinite Hill coefficient.
* **Spatial auto-correlation I(t)**. Plots a trajectory of the spatial index / auto-correlation over time.
* **Spatial auto-correlation Theta(t)**. Same as above, but now for Theta(t) (normalized with respect to the signalling strength fN).
* **Spatial cross-correlation**. Plots local cross-correlations between the two genes in the system with two molecules. Distances can be either the Hamming distance or Jacard distance between the two sets of gene expression values for each of the cells of each of the genes.
* **2D trajectory (p(t),I(t))**. Plots a trajectory in the (p,I) plane. The starting points are marked by coloured circles, while the endpoints are marked by circles with a cross. If there are two signals, both trajectories will be plotted.
* **2D trajectory (p(t),Theta(t))**. See above, for (p,Theta/fN).
* **Pseudo-energy h(t)**  Plots the pseudo-energy h(t) (see the Olimpio et al. paper). Only for 1 signal with binary cell states. 

#### Options
This contains a few optional features for running and displaying the simulations.
* **Show I**. Selecting this option will display the value of I on top of the figure. This might cause the simulation to run slightly slower.
* **Initiate with I(t=0)** (only for binary cells). Use the value of I(t=0) - or I1(t=0) and I2(t=0) in case of two signals - for the initial state. If unchecked (default), the system will generate an initial lattice by randomly selecting ON cells according to the value of p(t=0), without regard to the initial spatial order. This typically gives a value for I of around zero, but to be precise (up to 0.01), choose this option. The simulation will then run an algorithm to try to generate a lattice with the input I(t=0). As this is not always possible, the messages will display whether the outcome has been achieved or not. Note that for very high I, this can be a slow process.
* **Manually input initial state**. This allows the user to run a simulation from a user-specified initial state rather than a randomly generated initial state. If selected, the next time the user runs a new simulation, s/he will be prompted to manually input an excel file with the initial state (see below, "Format manual input initial state").

##### Format manual input initial state
For manually inputting cell states, the user should prepare an excel file with the gene expression levels of all the cells of the system (values between 0 and 1 for each cell). The format of the data can be of the same form as the format of the "cells" variable inside the app (i.e. a Nxl matrix where N="grid size"^2 is the number of cells and l is the number of signalling molecules). However, the user can also input files in a form that is more intuitive given the form of the lattice. For this, specify the cell states in a "grid size" times "grid size" matrix. If there are two molecules, use the first two sheets of the excel file to specify the expression levels of the two different genes. The grid size of the simulation must be set to the same value as that of the loaded excel file to be a valid input.

#### Properties
The controls under this menu allow you to examine certain features of the chosen parameter set.
* **Circuit topology**. This plots the gene circuit under consideration (according to the settings in the selected parameters tab). Blue arrows show activating interactions, red arrows show inhibiting interactions.
* **Phase diagram**. The phase diagram shows the "phase" of each interaction of the system. The plot is separated into two subplots for each of the signalling molecules. The markers (circles and triangles) show the values of the K and C_ON for a particular interaction. The number next to the marker indicates the gene that the signalling molecule controls. Circles are for activating interactions, triangles for repressive interactions. As a concrete example, a triangle in the lower figure with the number 1 indicates phase and the interaction parameters for a repressive interaction of molecule 2 on gene 1.
* **State diagram - single cell**. The state diagram shows all allowed transitions between the different states of a cell. In other words, it shows which states a cell can adopt at the next time step given its current state. For one molecule there are two states (0 and 1), for two molecules there are four ((0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)). The single cell state diagram shows the (deterministic) transitions for each of these states. For instance, an arrow between (0,0) and (1,1) means that a single cell with both genes off will always turn on both genes at the next time step. The diagrams depend on the set of parameters specified in the parameters tab.
* **State diagram - full system**. For the full system with N>=1 cells, the state diagram shows all possible transitions for any cell in the lattice. Transitions are no longer necessarily deterministic, so certain states can transition to multiple states depending on the states of its neighbours. For instance, a diagram with the (0,0) state linked to both (0,0) and (1,0) indicates that (0,0) cells can transition to either of the two states, depending on the signals they receive from other cells of the lattice.
* **Cell color legend**. This generates a legend displaying the correspondence between the colours of the simulation and the gene expression levels of the cells.
* **Periodicity test**. We devised a test to check if simulation has settled into a periodic motion (where the same limited set of states repeats itself). Clicking on "periodicity test" will run the test and display its results in the "Messages" box. 

#### Help
* **Documentation**. Opens the GitHub page for the app.

### Randomizing cell positions
An additional feature of the app is the ability to randomize the positions of the cell, such that they do not sit perfectly on top of a regular hexagonal lattice. To do this, we utilized a Monte Carlo algorithm from the study of hard spheres in statistical physics to randomize the cell locations (details will be provided in upcoming paper). The "degree of randomness" is determined by the number of Monte Carlo steps you let the algorithm run for. Generally, we do not recommend going to too high numbers or the algorithm might not finish in any reasonable time. In addition, the user can tune the size of the cells, which has an actual effect on the dynamics rather than being for display purposes only. If the size of the cells becomes large, the user should limit the number of Monte Carlo steps to take.

### Message box
Panel H displays messages to guide the user during the simulation. In particular, if certain steps take a long time the app might temporarily freeze, but the message box should display the task which is causing the slowdown.

---

### Troubleshooting
A list of known issues can be found under the issues page (https://github.com/YitengDang/Multicellularity/issues). In general, if the simulation gets stuck, try pressing the "STOP" (reset) button to see if it resolves the problem. Restarting the app sometimes also does magic. If you are running the app on a laptop, the responses to user input can be slow and the simulation might not run smoothly. Note also that the app needs to be able to save data to your folders to run. If you installed using the installation package, the folder is likely the default folder in which MATLAB stores apps. If you installed manually, choose a folder where you have write permission to deploy the app. Feel free to report any other issues you find on the issues page.
