Multicellular model simulation app v1.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation requirements
* MATLAB (R2017b, earlier versions might work)

Instructions
1. Execute the MATLAB Installer file named 'Multicellular model simulation v1.1'.
2. The program should unpack itself and install as an app in MATLAB. 
3. IMPORTANT: Create a folder for the simulation that contains a subfolder called '/data/dist_matrix_hex'. This is essential for correct storage of the cell-to-cell distances, so that lattice sizes that have been studied before will take a shorter time to load.
4. Run the app from MATLAB by going to the menu containing all the apps and clicking on the installed app.
